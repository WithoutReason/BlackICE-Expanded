 franceBiceE.00.t:0 "1936 Election: Unions go on Strike!"
 franceBiceE.00.d:0 "During the 1936 elections, a massive strike was organized by nearly all French labor unions. The strike was intended to put pressure on the government to quickly pass social reforms. The strike was largely successful, resulting in the Matignon Agreements which made gigantic concessions to the unions. After the passage of the reforms, the strikes ended."
 franceBiceE.00.a:0 "This could topple the government! STARTS CRISIS"
 franceBiceE.01.t:0 "Form a Coalition with the Conservatives"
 franceBiceE.01.d:0 "Forming a coalition government with the communists is rash and unnecessary. With tensions escalating with powers abroad and political instability at home, we can’t afford to experiment with new types of government now."
 franceBiceE.01.a:0 "We shall seek to form a stable government."
 franceBiceE.02.t:0 "Electoral Gridlock in France"
 franceBiceE.02.d:0 "The election is over, and the triumphant socialists have failed to form a government. With France’s future uncertain, radical groups are seizing the opportunity to cause chaos and press forward their agendas. The already crushing union strikes are intensifying as workers all over the country band together to demand reform, the far-right is calling for blood, and the Soviets are eyeing France as ripe for revolution.\n\nOur government is falling apart at the seams. However, before we are pushed from power, we have the opportunity to throw our support behind one of these radical groups. In essence, we can play kingmaker – choosing to support the far-right leagues, or the communists. We must quickly make a stand before the political violence escalates into civil war!"
 franceBiceE.02.a:0 "This is the end of the Third Republic..."
 franceBiceE.03.t:0 "Communists Demand Spanish Intervention"
 franceBiceE.03.d:0 "The Spanish Civil War is not going well for the Republicans. From the outbreak of the conflict, the communists have argued for intervention, but Blum has always pushed for neutrality. Now the issue has come to a head – the communists are threatening to pull their support from the Popular Front if we do not do something to help the Spanish Republicans.\n\nIf the communists leave the Popular Front, it will cause our government to collapse. However, if we do intervene, it will deeply upset our allies and potentially cause an all-out war with Germany and Italy. If we intervene in Spain and Germany declares war on us, we will have to fight them alone."
 franceBiceE.03.a:0 "We cannot ignore the Spanish any longer! STARTS CRISIS"
 franceBiceE.04.t:0 "A Great Power in Name Only"
 franceBiceE.04.d:0 "France is not what she used to be. The Great War has left deep scars on our county that have yet to fully heal. Hitler’s Germany is now outcompeting us in nearly every category - Their economy is double our own and is growing rapidly, they also have double our manpower reserves, and their weapons are more advanced than our own.\n\nOur Grande Armee is still one of the best in Europe, but it is quickly being eclipsed by the rising power of Germany. Most of our equipment is leftover from the Great War and our nation lacks modern tanks. Our Airforce is sizeable, but entirely obsolete. Most of our planes are old biplanes from decades past. Our efforts to design and build modern aircraft have thus far been laughably unsuccessful. Our Navy, once considered one of the best in the world, is now second-rate at best. We are currently completely reliant on Britain’s Royal Navy in the case that a war breaks out.\n\nOur nation may look strong on paper, but in practice we are dangerously weak. We must navigate the oncoming political crises and rearm our nation as best we can with the time we have left."
 franceBiceE.04.a:0 "Nonsense! Surely our nation isn't that weak!"
 franceBiceE.05.t:0 "Tensions Rise as the 1936 Election Approaches"
 franceBiceE.05.d:0 "As the 1936 Legislative Elections draw near, tensions are rapidly rising amongst the major French political factions. The Communists are radicalizing the factory workers and union members who have long been suffering under our stagnant economy. The Fascists in the Far-Right Leagues are becoming more violent, inflicting terror in the population.\n\nThe support for the radicals has reached a breaking point. The Socialists and Communists have banded together and will almost certainly win the upcoming election unless drastic action is taken. In the upcoming chaos, Fascists groups will also be looking for their opportunity to strike. If we are not extremely careful, this could be the end of democracy in France."
 franceBiceE.05.a:0 "Vive la République!"
 franceBiceE.06.t:0 "France Demands that All Nations Embargo Germany"
 franceBiceE.06.d:0 "France is attempting to starve Germany of strategic resources. To that end, France is demanding that all European nations that are still conducting trade with Germany embargo them immediately. This would stop all trade with Germany, massively angering the Reich and may even give Germany a reason to declare war on us. Refusing might upset France. It looks like will need to choose a side sooner rather than later."
 franceBiceE.06.a:0 "Refuse: Our trade with Germany is far too valuable."
 franceBiceE.06.b:0 "Accept: Embargo Germany and her allies."
 franceBiceE.07.t:0 "[From.GetName] Stops all Trade with Germany"
 franceBiceE.07.d:0 "[From.GetName] has accepted our demands and has placed an embargo on Germany."
 franceBiceE.07.a:0 "The noose tightens."
 franceBiceE.08.t:0 "[From.GetName] Refuses to Embargo Germany"
 franceBiceE.08.d:0 "[From.GetName] has refused our demands and will continue to support Germany."
 franceBiceE.08.a:0 "Disappointing."
 franceBiceE.09.t:0 "The French Ultimatum"
 franceBiceE.09.d:0 "France has sent an ultimatum to us demanding that we stop all trade with Germany or France will declare war on us. Time has run out, we must choose a side."
 franceBiceE.09.a:0 "Refuse: We stand with Germany."
 franceBiceE.09.b:0 "Accept: Embargo Germany and her allies."
 franceBiceE.10.t:0 "[From.GetName] Stops all Trade with Germany"
 franceBiceE.10.d:0 "[From.GetName] has accepted our demands and has placed an embargo on Germany."
 franceBiceE.10.a:0 "The noose tightens."
 franceBiceE.11.t:0 "[From.GetName] Refuses to Embargo Germany"
 franceBiceE.11.d:0 "[From.GetName] has refused our demands and will continue to support Germany."
 franceBiceE.11.a:0 "Declare war!"
 franceBiceE.11.b:0 "We shouldn't be making more enemies right now."
 franceBiceE.12.t:0 "France Backs Down"
 franceBiceE.12.d:0 "France has decided to leave us out of their war. We are free to trade with whomever we please."
 franceBiceE.12.a:0 "Pathetic."
 franceBiceE.13.t:0 "France Asks for Help in Spain"
 franceBiceE.13.d:0 "France has chosen to intervene in Spain, and they are asking us for aid. The British public are vehemently opposed to war of any kind and helping the Spanish Republicans might drag our nation into a larger world conflict if we are not careful. Right now, France is only asking for guns and supplies to help arm the Spanish Republicans.\n\nHowever, if we help France now, they will almost certainly come back later asking us for more help – perhaps asking for us to join their war in Spain. We should treat France’s request for aid with caution, as things could quickly spiral out of control. If we are not careful, our intervention could be the spark that ignites the world in another Great War."
 franceBiceE.13.a:0 "We can spare some equipment for the Spanish Republicans"
 franceBiceE.13.b:0 "France can handle Spain on their own."
 franceBiceE.14.t:0 "Britian Agrees to Donate Equipment"
 franceBiceE.14.d:0 "The British have agreed to help the Spanish fight for democracy."
 franceBiceE.14.a:0 "For democracy!"
 franceBiceE.15.t:0 "Britian Refuses to Aid the Spanish"
 franceBiceE.15.d:0 "The British have refused to intervene in the Spanish Civil War."
 franceBiceE.15.a:0 "Disappointing."
 franceBiceE.16.t:0 "France Asks for British Intervention in Spain"
 franceBiceE.16.d:0 "France has chosen to intervene in Spain, and they are asking us for aid. The British public are vehemently opposed to war of any kind and helping the Spanish Republicans might drag our nation into a larger world conflict if we are not careful. The other fascist powers in Europe, such as Germany and Italy have already intervened in Spain and tensions are rising rapidly.\n\nIf we intervene, Germany and the other fascist powers in Europe might declare war on France and us. Our rearmament programmes are still not complete, and if we were to go to war right now, it could be disastrous. We must carefully consider France’s offer; while they are our friend, their brash actions in Spain could lead to another World War."
 franceBiceE.16.a:0 "We will stand with France against fascism!"
 franceBiceE.16.b:0 "We cannot risk starting another World War!"
 franceBiceE.17.t:0 "The Last Strikes are Broken"
 franceBiceE.17.d:0 "The union strikers have been crushed. While the radical Far Right Leagues have certain benefited from these decisions, they are not real threat to us anymore. France is free from radical political parties for now and we can all finally get back to work."
 franceBiceE.17.a:0 "At last, things can return to normal."
 franceBiceE.18.t:0 "Officially Recognize the Spanish State"
 franceBiceE.18.d:0 "We may not like it, but the Spanish people must decide their own future. The Republicans are all but beaten already. Germany and Italy have thrown their support behind Fascist Spain and if we intervened now it would certainly cause an all-out war. We must buy more time to rearm our military! We will come back and confront Germany and Italy, but only once we have an army that will strike terror into them."
 franceBiceE.18.a:0 "This is the New Spain."
 franceBiceE.19.t:0 "Inspire Spanish Democracy"
 franceBiceE.19.d:0 "We have given the Spanish people the tools they need to forge their own future. If there is a will, there is a way. Now we just need to make sure the Spaniards choose the correct way. After giving the Republicans massive amounts of aid for their civil war, we can demand that they keep communists out of their government and that they keep a safe distance away from the Soviets."
 franceBiceE.19.a:0 "The Spaniards will choose their own destiny."
 franceBiceE.20.t:0 "Turn Spain Into Our Puppet"
 franceBiceE.20.d:0 "The Republicans performance during the Spanish Civil War does not inspire confidence. Even if we help them win their way, their government might just collapse anyways. Level heads are needed to rebuild Spain, and we are up to the task. The Spanish and British might not be happy with our decision, but drastic measures are needed to keep Spain from devolving into complete chaos and fascism.\n\nAny one-sided benefits we may or may not get from this arrangement are purely coincidental."
 franceBiceE.20.a:0 "Yes... Purely coincidental..."
